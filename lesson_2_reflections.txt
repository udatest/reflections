Q: What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates all the metadata directories it needs to keep track of versions.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
   What value do you think it offers?

- Working directory:  files keep changing, there are no backups.
- Repository:  files have been checked in.  They cannot be changed.
- Staging area:  region in between.  Not yet in repository but saves a copy while you work
  in the working directory.
